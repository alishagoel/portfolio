		<p style="font-style: italic; color: lightyellow;">Currently an ongoing project.</p>
		<p>NYU Augmented Library is a Vertically Integrated Project team whose goal is to produce a fully functioning app to help NYU students access Bern Dibner Library's resources in one place. I am currently the <span style="font-style: italic;color: lightyellow;"> Frontend Lead </span>, formerly the iOS Lead, and we are currently working on updating the app's UI and creating a ML book recommendation feature.</p>
		<p>I helped code the initial app from scratch using Swift UI. I made all the 3D models for the app using Adobe Dimenion and Blender, and I am currently working on updating them to be more interactive. Here are some of the initial models that were integrated into the application.</p>

		<p>I tried to imitate the real dibner library as much as I can by paying a lot of attention to details like the carpet texture, the placement of posters, outdoor view of the window, etc. The app functionality so far lets you experience six different room structures in AR of the library. In the future, we aim to provide customized book recomendations and more interactive elements in the AR.</p>
