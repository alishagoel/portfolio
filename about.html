	<h2 class="centertext">ABOUT ALISHA GOEL</h2>
	<p>Alisha Goel is a New York-based computer scientist, game designer, photographer and journalist. She's currently at New York University, where she is studying an interesting intersection between Computer Science and Integrated Design & Media. Some of her previous works ranges from space-exploration projects at NASA, being the Multimedia Editor at NYU's independent school newspaper Washington Square News, leading a research AR team and designing cool game UIs at a Brooklyn indie game studio.  </p>
	<p>Her photojournalism is inspired by artistic and technological stories actively happening around her, but her photography also stretches beyond the realm of photojournalism and into the world of weird and mildly disturbing sometimes. She loves combining her coding skills and visual storytelling abilites to create interesting interactive user-driven experiences. You can find her on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alisha-goel-10128222b/">LinkedIn</a> or email her at ag8251@nyu.edu.</p> </div> </div>
